    "### LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n",
    "*In this lab you will learn how to*\n",
    "- How to read and understand the code in a Scrapy Spider class\n",
    "- Write a spider to scrape job post from Indeed.com\n",
    "\n",
    "The following class IndeedSpider is incomplete. It is missing code for two functions: **fill_url_list** and **build_indeed_url**. These functions build and populate a list with every unqiue combination of job search URLs based on the job query key terms provided below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Direction\n",
    "1. Build those functions and scrape Indeed.com \n",
    "2. Annotate every line of code with a short description on how what that line of code is doing\n",
    "\n",
    "## NOTE: \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're finished proto-type these two functions in this notebook, copy the code over to the scrapy files but **DO NOT SCRAPE ALL 9 Choose 3 PAGES**. If everyone does this, GA will be blocked from visiting Indeed.com by the site's servers. Instead, only run 2 or 3 URLS to test and verify that your code works. \n",
