    "    nerdy_long: the pivot_table() function takes a dataframe to pivot as its first argument\n",

    "- **`values`**: a single column indicating the values to use when pivoting and filling in the new wide format columns\n",
    "- **`index`**: columns in the long format data that are index variables – this means that these will be left as single columns, not spread out across columns by unique value such as in the columns parameter \n",
    "- **`aggfunc`**: often pivot_table() is used to perform a summary of the data. aggfunc stands for \"aggregation function\". It is required and defaults to np.mean. You can put your own function in, which I do below.\n",

    "    \n",
    "I am putting in my own function, `select_item_or_nan()` to the `aggfunc` keyword argument. Because my `subject_id` column has a single variable value for each id, I just want the single element in the long format value cell. My data is messy and so I have to write a function to check for some places it can break. \n",
